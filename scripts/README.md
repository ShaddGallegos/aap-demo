# aap-demo helper scripts

Utility scripts used during development and local deployment. These are not invoked
automatically by `aap-demo` unless noted below.

## Host preparation (Linux + CRC)

### Interactive temp swap (`aap-demo create`)

On **Linux (Fedora/RHEL)**, the first interactive cluster create prompts for a
temporary swap file before CPU and RAM allocation.

```text
Resource allocation for CRC VM:
  Host: 16 CPUs, 30GB RAM (8GB swap)

  Create temp swap for deploy? [Y/n]:
  Temp swap size in GB [16]:
  CPUs [8]:
  Memory in GB [16]:
```

Default swap file: `/swapfile-aap-demo` via `mkswap` + `swapon`.

#### Filesystem notes

- **btrfs** (Fedora): uses `chattr +C` + `dd` (not `fallocate`)
- **xfs/ext4** (RHEL): uses `fallocate`, falls back to `dd`
- **SELinux** (RHEL): applies `swapfile_t` context when enforcing

Non-interactive create (CI or scripted):

```bash
AAP_ENABLE_TEMP_SWAP=true AAP_SWAP_SIZE_GB=24 QUIET=true aap-demo create
SKIP_TEMP_SWAP=true aap-demo create   # never enable swap
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `AAP_SWAP_SIZE_GB` | `16` | Swap file size when enabled |
| `AAP_SWAP_FILE` | `/swapfile-aap-demo` | Path to the swap file |
| `AAP_ENABLE_TEMP_SWAP` | `false` | Enable swap during non-interactive create |
| `SKIP_TEMP_SWAP` | `false` | Skip swap prompt and enable |

### `local-prereq.sh`

One-time workstation setup before the first `aap-demo deploy` on Fedora or other
Linux distributions using CRC (OpenShift Local):

```bash
./scripts/local-prereq.sh
./scripts/local-prereq.sh --deploy  # prepare, then deploy from this checkout
./scripts/local-prereq.sh --full    # install CRC, deploy, and enable the demo suite
```

The script resolves the repository from its own location, so either command can
be launched from any working directory. `--deploy` runs that checkout's
`aap-demo.sh` rather than relying on an `aap-demo` command in `PATH`.

`--full` performs the complete Linux x86_64 workstation bootstrap:

1. Import `~/Downloads/pull-secret.txt` (or the path passed with `--pull-secret`)
2. Install the `aap-demo` command and its dependencies
3. Download and install CRC to `~/.local/bin` when needed
4. Add the current user to the `libvirt` group and run `crc setup`
5. Deploy AAP and enable `mcp-server`, `apme-eap`, `product-demos`, and `ao`

The Red Hat pull secret must still be downloaded manually because console authentication
is required. Optional APME GitHub integration is skipped in full mode and can be configured
later. Override the CRC artifact URL for mirrors with `CRC_DOWNLOAD_URL`.

Temp swap is handled by `aap-demo create` on Linux (see above), not this script.

### `enable-temp-swap.sh`

Manual swap management on Linux when you are not running interactive create:

```bash
./scripts/enable-temp-swap.sh
AAP_SWAP_SIZE_GB=24 ./scripts/enable-temp-swap.sh
./scripts/enable-temp-swap.sh status
./scripts/enable-temp-swap.sh disable
```

`aap-demo destroy` also removes temp swap on Linux (requires sudo for `swapoff`).

### `test-temp-swap-flow.sh`

End-to-end host test (requires sudo): disable → enable → `aap-demo create` with
`AAP_ENABLE_TEMP_SWAP`. Run in an interactive terminal:

```bash
./scripts/test-temp-swap-flow.sh
```

## Deployment checks

### `preflight-checks.sh`

Validates CLI dependencies (`kubectl`, `ansible-playbook`, `jq`, etc.) before
operator deployment. Called internally by deploy flows; can also be run directly.

## Development

### `setup-linting.sh`

Installs pre-commit hooks and lint tooling for contributors.

### `require-tool.sh`

Pre-commit helper that verifies a tool exists before executing it.

### `check-version-bump.sh`

Legacy helper retained for historical release checks. It is no longer invoked by normal pull
requests, CI, or pre-commit hooks; the version workflow only validates semver format.
