# ADR-024: Ollama Addon

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2026-09-11

**Authors**: Chad Ferman

## Context

aap-demo supports Automation Orchestrator (AO) as an optional addon (ADR-017) and wires AO
integrations automatically via `addon-wire.sh` (ADR-023). AO supports an `llm_provider`
integration type that connects it to a chat-completions-compatible LLM endpoint, enabling AI-assisted
workflow generation and agent capabilities.

MicroShift VMs in CRC normally expose no GPU and have limited public egress. Other supported
clusters may advertise NVIDIA GPUs to Kubernetes. Pointing AO at a cloud LLM
service requires external API keys and introduces a dependency on internet connectivity that
does not match the offline-demo goal of aap-demo. A locally deployed LLM removes both
constraints: no API key, no egress requirement.

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) supports NVIDIA acceleration with a CPU fallback and exposes an
OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint. `phi4-mini` (~2.5 GB) fits within the MicroShift VM memory budget and is compact
enough to pull at install time without making the first demo session impractical.

## Decision

Add an `ollama` addon that deploys Ollama with `phi4-mini` pre-pulled to a dedicated
`aap-demo-ollama` namespace and wires it into AO as an `llm_provider` integration.

### Files

| Action | Path | Responsibility |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Create | `addons/ollama/ollama.yaml` | All Kubernetes resources for the Ollama deployment |
| Create | `addons/ollama/deploy.sh` | Deploy and delete actions |
| Modify | `includes/addon-wire.sh` | `wire_ollama_*` helpers; Ollama route in allowed-hosts; `aap_demo_wire` call |
| Modify | `aap-demo.sh` | Add `ollama` to `AVAILABLE_ADDONS` and help text |

### Kubernetes resources

| Resource | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Namespace | `aap-demo-ollama` | `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged` |
| ServiceAccount | `ollama` | In `aap-demo-ollama` |
| ClusterRoleBinding | `aap-demo-ollama-anyuid` | Grants `system:openshift:scc:anyuid` to the SA |
| PVC | `ollama-data` | 20 Gi, `topolvm-provisioner` (RWO), mounted at `/root/.ollama` |
| Deployment | `ollama` | `ollama/ollama:latest`, port 11434, readiness probe on `/api/tags` |
| Service | `ollama` | ClusterIP, port 11434 |
| Route | `ollama` | `ollama.<cluster-apps-domain>`, TLS edge termination |

Resource limits for the Ollama container:

```yaml
requests:
  cpu: 200m
  memory: 2Gi
limits:
  cpu: "4"
  memory: 8Gi
  nvidia.com/gpu: "1" # only when advertised by a node
```

The CPU request stays small so an idle Ollama pod can still schedule beside AAP and
other addons on a single-node CRC VM. The 4-core limit is unchanged, so inference can
burst. `phi4-mini` comfortably fits within 8 Gi for CPU inference while leaving headroom
for AAP.

`deploy.sh` detects the total `nvidia.com/gpu` allocatable resource across nodes. In
automatic mode it requests one GPU when present and otherwise renders no GPU limit. Users
can force CPU or require NVIDIA with `OLLAMA_GPU=cpu` or `OLLAMA_GPU=nvidia`. Requiring
NVIDIA fails before applying the manifest when the resource is unavailable. The Deployment
uses the `Recreate` strategy so an update does not deadlock while the old pod holds the
cluster's only GPU.

### Cluster domain detection

`deploy.sh` reads the existing AAP route host to derive the cluster apps domain, then
constructs `ollama.<domain>`. Falls back to `ollama.apps.127.0.0.1.nip.io` when AAP is not
yet deployed. This mirrors the pattern used by `mcp-server/deploy.sh`.

### Model pull

After the Deployment reaches rollout, `deploy.sh` posts to the in-cluster ClusterIP
(`http://<svc-ip>:11434/api/pull`) rather than the route hostname. This avoids nip.io
resolution issues in laptop-side shell scripts and mirrors the approach used elsewhere in
aap-demo for in-cluster API calls. The script polls for up to 5 minutes; phi4-mini is
~2.5 GB. If the pull does not complete within that window a warning is printed with a manual
pull command.

### AO wiring

Three new helpers in `addon-wire.sh`:

```bash
wire_ollama_deployed()      # kubectl get deployment ollama -n aap-demo-ollama
wire_ollama_route_host()    # kubectl get route ... -o jsonpath '{.spec.host}'
wire_ollama_url_for_ao()    # https://<route-host>/v1
```

`wire_ao_ollama()` creates or updates:

1. An **LLM Provider** credential named `aap-demo Ollama` with `api_key: "ollama"` (Ollama  # pragma: allowlist secret
   has no authentication; the placeholder satisfies AO's required field).
2. An `llm_provider` integration named `aap-demo Ollama` with `provider_hint: "custom"`,
   `base_url` set to the `/v1` route URL, and `insecure_skip_tls_verify: true`.

The Ollama route hostname is also added to `wire_ao_integration_allowed_hosts_json` so AO's
SSRF allow-list is updated before the integration is created.

`wire_ao_ollama` is called from `aap_demo_wire` after `wire_ao_mcp`. A failure emits a
warning and does not abort the overall wire run.

### AO wiring is optional

If AO is not installed, the addon still deploys and prints the route endpoint; wiring is
skipped silently. Re-running `aap-demo enable ollama` is idempotent — `kubectl apply` and
`wire_ao_ensure_*` are both upsert operations.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Provides an offline-capable LLM endpoint for AO agent workflows and AI-assisted workflow
  generation without cloud API keys or internet egress.
- Follows existing addon patterns exactly — same file layout as `addons/registry/`, same
  AO wiring pattern as `addons/mcp-server/`.
- Idempotent: re-running enable is safe; `OLLAMA_MODEL=<other>` lets operators pull
  additional models without redeploying.

### Negative

- phi4-mini pull is ~2.5 GB and takes several minutes on first enable.
- CPU fallback inference is slow for large prompts — acceptable for demo but not production use.
- 20 Gi PVC on `topolvm-provisioner` consumes significant VM disk space.
- AO credentials/integration persist after `aap-demo disable ollama`; they become invalid
  automatically but must be removed manually from the AO UI if unwanted.

### Neutral

- CRC MicroShift VMs still use CPU unless GPU passthrough and a device plugin expose
  `nvidia.com/gpu` to the node.
- Additional models can be pulled but require extra disk space.
- Ollama has no native authentication; the `api_key: "ollama"` placeholder is purely  # pragma: allowlist secret
  structural.

## Alternatives Considered

**Cloud LLM endpoint (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock)**: Requires an external API key and
internet connectivity. Breaks offline demo goals. Rejected.

**llama.cpp directly in a container**: More complex image build, no standard API until wrapped.
Ollama already bundles llama.cpp with an OpenAI-compatible HTTP server. Rejected.

**Different model (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B)**: Larger download and higher memory pressure on
MicroShift VMs. phi4-mini is sufficient for AO agent use cases within the VM memory budget.
Users can pull additional models post-install via `OLLAMA_MODEL=<name> aap-demo enable ollama`.
Rejected as the default.

**Shared Ollama in `aap-operator` namespace**: Avoids a separate namespace but couples Ollama
lifecycle to AAP, complicates SCC grants, and contradicts the pattern in ADR-008 (addons are
independent). Rejected.
