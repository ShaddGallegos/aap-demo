# ADR-017: Automation Orchestrator Addon (ao)

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2026-07-15 (updated 2026-09-16)

**Authors**: Chad Ferman

## Context

Automation Orchestrator (AO) is Red Hat's workflow orchestration platform. It runs as an
operator-managed application on OpenShift and can integrate with Ansible Automation Platform
(job templates, OIDC).

aap-demo needs a repeatable, scriptable way to deploy AO on **MicroShift** for development and
demos, without requiring users to obtain private Quay credentials or run multi-step manual installs.

## Decision

Add `ao` to the aap-demo addon system as [`addons/ao/deploy.sh`](../../addons/ao/deploy.sh),
invoked automatically by `aap-demo deploy` and explicitly via `aap-demo enable ao`.

### Current install model (GA + GitOps manifests, 2026-08-21)

The addon applies **checked-in Kubernetes manifests** shaped like
[`aapctl install ao --dry-run`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/automation_orchestrator/2026.8/install-generate_aapctl_manifests_for_gitops).
**`aapctl` is not required at install time** — only `kubectl`/`oc` and a cluster from
`aap-demo deploy`.

| Aspect | Choice |
|--------|--------|
| Addon ID | `ao` (`ao-eap` accepted as legacy alias) |
| App namespace | `automation-orchestrator` |
| Operator install | OLM `Subscription` + `OperatorGroup` (AllNamespaces) in app namespace |
| Operator catalog | AO-local CatalogSource identity proxies a healthy source catalog Service; fallback/explicit images use a source-namespace catalog pod |
| Operator channel | `stable` default (`AO_OPERATOR_CHANNEL` override) |
| Index fallback | Early-access build index when default AAP catalog lacks AO |
| PostgreSQL | CloudNativePG from upstream manifest (dev-only; not Red Hat supported) |
| Instance | `AutomationOrchestrator` CR from [`manifests/automationorchestrator-cr.yaml`](../../addons/ao/manifests/automationorchestrator-cr.yaml) |
| Database secrets | `orchestrator-postgres-secret`, `temporal-postgres-secret`, `temporal-visibility-postgres-secret` (created at install, not committed) |
| Registry auth | `automation-orchestrator-pull-secret` from `~/.aap-demo/pull-secret.txt` (`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`; do not copy the OLM catalog secret) |

Manifest templates and apply order: [`addons/ao/manifests/README.md`](../../addons/ao/manifests/README.md).

User-facing guide: [`addons/ao/README.md`](../../addons/ao/README.md).

### MicroShift workarounds

| Problem | Cause | Workaround |
|---------|-------|------------|
| OLM can't resolve AO subscription | Catalog in `aap-operator`; subscription in another namespace | Keep the CatalogSource in `automation-orchestrator`, proxying a healthy source catalog Service; create fallback/explicit image pods in the source namespace |
| Second OperatorGroup in `aap-operator` | AO operator requires AllNamespaces; AAP already has `aap-operator-og` | Install AO OLM resources only in `automation-orchestrator` |
| CNPG via OLM fails | No `certified-operators` on MicroShift | Install CNPG from upstream release manifest |
| Catalog signature failures | MicroShift 4.22+ GPG policy on `registry.redhat.io` | Shared [`includes/olm-catalog-signature.sh`](../../includes/olm-catalog-signature.sh): relax `policy.json`, reload CRI-O, `wait_for_catalog_ready()` with auto-recovery; `ensure_catalog_signature_policy()` before AO catalog create |
| Postgres password drift on re-run | Secret regenerated but CNPG cluster retains bootstrap password | Reuse password from existing secrets; `FORCE=1` recreates cluster |
| AO missing from default index | Index version / publish lag | Automatic `AO_FALLBACK_INDEX_IMAGE` |
| AAP credential SSRF (`base_url is not permitted by SSRF policy`) | AO re-resolves the AAP route hostname at job time; MicroShift's DNS operator wipes the CoreDNS rewrite so the name does not resolve and SSRF fails. `*.svc.cluster.local` is separately blocked as Kubernetes internal DNS. | `hostAliases` on AO backend/worker pods map route hostnames to the ingress router ClusterIP (`wire_ao_route_host_aliases` / `ao_pod_route_host_aliases`); CoreDNS rewrite is still restored when possible |

### Global CatalogSource experiment (2026-09-21)

We evaluated replacing the AO-local CatalogSource with one shared
`redhat-operators` CatalogSource in `openshift-marketplace`, referenced by the AO
Subscription with `sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace`.

The disposable MicroShift cluster accepted the global CatalogSource and exposed the
AO package through `packagemanifest`. However, a fresh AO install failed OLM
resolution repeatedly for both the default and fallback index images:

```text
ResolutionFailed: constraints not satisfiable: no operators found from catalog
redhat-operators in namespace openshift-marketplace referenced by subscription
automation-orchestrator-operator
```

This repository installs OLM with `operator-sdk olm install`, whose resolver requires
the CatalogSource, OperatorGroup, and Subscription to share the AO namespace for this
operator. Patching an already-installed Subscription to the global source reported
`AtLatestKnown`, but that did not represent a fresh resolution and was not considered
valid evidence.

The global design is therefore rejected for the current runtime. Keep the AO-local
CatalogSource and Subscription together until the OLM installation path or operator
resolution behavior changes; re-test the global design as a fresh install if either
changes.

### Delete flow

`deploy.sh --delete` / `aap-demo disable ao`:

1. Optional: `aapctl uninstall` if `aapctl` is on PATH
2. Remove `AutomationOrchestrator` CR and AO OLM resources
3. Delete `automation-orchestrator` namespace
4. Remove legacy EA CatalogSources if present
5. Delete CloudNativePG operator manifest (when installed by this addon)

### aap-demo.sh integration

- `ao` in `AVAILABLE_ADDONS`; `ao-eap` normalized via `_normalize_addon_name()`
- Standard `aap-demo deploy` enables `ao` after AAP becomes ready
- Pass-through: `--force`, `--refresh-catalog`
- `show_status`: AO route URL when enabled
- Post-install wiring via [`includes/addon-wire.sh`](../../includes/addon-wire.sh): registers global
  **AAP** and **MCP Server** integrations automatically after enable and deploy (see ADR-023).
  **`mcp-server` is a hard dependency of `ao`** — `aap-demo enable ao` enables MCP first.

### Concurrent workflow synchronization (2026-09-16)

The AAP control job synchronizes the pinned AO workflow exports concurrently. The preparation
play creates one isolated local worker host per export; a second play runs the existing
per-workflow normalization and AO API upsert tasks with Ansible's `free` strategy. The control
job template is configured for ten forks, matching the current ten-export bundle.

This keeps normalization facts isolated to one workflow, prevents one export's triggers or nodes
from leaking into another, and avoids unnecessary one-by-one API waits. Completion order is
intentionally nondeterministic, and effective concurrency remains bounded by the AAP fork limit
and AO API capacity.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Single command: `aap-demo enable ao`
- No Quay POC, no `gh`, no runtime `aapctl` dependency
- Manifests track Red Hat GitOps documentation; maintainers can refresh with `generate-manifests.sh`
- Idempotent with explicit `FORCE=1` reinstall path

### Negative

- MicroShift-specific catalog copy and CNPG path differ from stock OpenShift / `aapctl install`
- Dev-only CNPG Postgres is not production-supported
- Default `stable` channel; use `AO_OPERATOR_CHANNEL=early-access` when needed

### Neutral

- AO isolated in `automation-orchestrator`; AAP remains in `aap-operator`
- `aapctl` remains optional for uninstall cleanup and manifest regeneration

## Alternatives considered

**Runtime `aapctl install`**: Matches Red Hat interactive docs but pulls in Technology Preview
CLI, hardcoded full-OCP catalog assumptions, and non-deterministic dry-run secrets. Rejected for
default path; manifest shape retained.

**Subscription in `aap-operator`**: Matches AAP pattern but breaks OLM when two OperatorGroups
occupy the same namespace. Rejected.

**Private EA index + Quay**: Original Early Access flow. Rejected after GA operator landed in
`redhat-operator-index`.

## Historical note: Early Access flow (superseded 2026-08-20)

The original addon (`ao-eap`) used a private Quay index, `aapctl` end-to-end, catalog-operator
patches, and `openshift-marketplace`. That flow is **no longer the default**. Legacy state paths
(`~/.aap-demo/ao-eap-state`) are still read when present. See git history before 2026-08-21 for
the full EA install sequence.
